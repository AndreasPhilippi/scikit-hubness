================================================
scikit-learn examples adapted for scikit-hubness
================================================

Examples concerning using :mod:`skhubness.neighbors`
as drop-in replacement for :mod:`sklearn.neighbors`.

These examples are taken from scikit-learn and demonstrate the ease of transition
from ``sklearn.neighbors`` to ``skhubness.neighbors``.
You will find that many examples require no more than modifying an import line,
and/or adding one argument when instantiating an estimator.

Note, that these examples are not intended to demonstrate improved learning performance
due to hubness reduction (the data are rather low-dimensional).
